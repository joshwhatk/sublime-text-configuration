# Zen Tabs Settings

[Github](https://github.com/travmik/ZenTabs)

I had the limit lower previously, but I found that it would delete tabs that I was currently working on, so I upped it to 30. Now it keeps it from getting insane, but doesn't really kill many tabs.

My main use for this package is to keep the tabs full width with no truncated names, and to show better which tabs have been modified.

**ZenTabs.sublime-settings**:

```
{
    "open_tab_limit":  30
}
```
