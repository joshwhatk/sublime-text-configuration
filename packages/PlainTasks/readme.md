# PlainTasks Settings

[Github](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks)

When working with this package, I really enjoy using `Tabs: 2` to keep it simple. Also I set the date format to be a little easier for my western eyes to read.

**PlainTasks.sublime-settings**:

```
{
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": false,
  "date_format": "(%m-%d-%y)"
}
```
