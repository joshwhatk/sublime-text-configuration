# Babel Settings

[Github](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime)

This is a work in progress, but I currently use Babel for ES6 and TypeScript syntax highlighting.

I also overwrite the default theme when working with Javascript, I use the [Zeus theme](/themes).

For how to set up Babel for all JavaScript files, check out the instructions [here](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) and, to get set up with eslint, check out [Jonathan Creamer's Post](http://jonathancreamer.com/setup-eslint-with-es6-in-sublime-text/).

**JavaScript (Babel).sublime-settings**:

```
{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/User/Themes/Zeus-Sublime-Text.tmTheme",
  "extensions":
  [
    "js"
  ]
}
```
