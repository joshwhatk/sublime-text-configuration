# PHP Companion Settings

[Github](https://github.com/erichard/SublimePHPCompanion)

I like for my import statements to be sorted by length and for the default visibility of automatically created properties to be protected.

**PHPCompanion.sublime-settings**:

```
{
  // Sort the list of use statements by their line length
  "use_sort_length": true,

  // Visibility of properties generated by the "insert constructor property"
  // command. "public", "protected" or "private"
  "visibility": "protected"
}
```
