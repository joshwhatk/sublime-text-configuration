# Themes

For development, I use `pastel (SL)` by [Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes), for Javscript I use the [Oceanic Next theme](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme), and for Markdown, I use `MarkdownEditing`'s theme.

I also use [Fira Code Light](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as the default font-face, here's hoping for ligature support in Sublime.
